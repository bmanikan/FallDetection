# FallDetection
Research project FallDetection

For a given dynamic stream of video, a fall detection system should be able to recognize the actions of the users in the environment. This is a binary classification problem with two categories and are usually referred to as action recognition. This type of classification can be utilized in recognizing the critical behaviour of the user such as falls. The data for recognizing the fall is obtained from surveillance cameras recording the users’ behavior in the given environment. The detection system focuses on differentiating the falling activity from other common activities (e.g., Activities of Daily Living) to provide immediate attention. Such system can be deployed in home care facilities or elders’ homes to recognize the falls and provide immediate medical care for the user.
