# FallDetection
Research project FallDetection

Falls are a prominent cause of mortality and severe injury in the general population, particularly among the elderly. It is important to keep track of them and provide them with the care they need as quickly as possible, therefore lowering their risk of long-term injury or death. Current fall detection systems use data from sensors or video cameras in various ways. False positives are common in systems relying on sensors data, and privacy is a major concern in vision-based systems because of operating system limitations. This paper solves the issue by proposing a technique for detecting falls based on RGB images using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) utilizing movement trace characteristics generated by a modified Structural similarity index (SSIM) that can be later integrated into a system that monitors the movements of patients, recognizes a fall, and automatically sends a request for help to the caregivers. The proposed approach relies on camera system and is assessed against the UR-FALL dataset, outperforming the results of previous fall detection systems that use the same dataset. Our approach achieves 98% accuracy and a F1-Score of 99%. As a consequence of our model's reliance on readily accessible sensors and superior performance on the UR Fall Detection dataset, we believe it may be a viable option for reliable fall detection in the real world.
