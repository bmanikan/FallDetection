Research Paper design,
The Conference requires 12-15 page for submission. and 6-11 pages for show.
We will have 6 Sections out of which 2 are for Introduction and Conclusion. 

Page distribution:
* Introduction 	>> 1 
* Abstract 		>> 0.5
* Conclusion 	>> 1
* section 2 	>> 2
* section 3,4,5 >> 3 each

Section 3,4,5 talks about the approach in detail.
We will have a Pseudocode for explaining the working of our approach.
Also, have corresponding images and Tables wherever necessary.

1. Decide on three titles for the paper ( mostly formed from the keywords )
2. 5 - 6 keywords for the research paper
3. Decide on Section titles (for intermediate 4)
4. Design the Page distributions for sections.

We will take multiple turns to review and edit before finalisation.

For journal paper, we will retain most of the information we specify in the initial conf. paper and add on top of it.
